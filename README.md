## Problem

This challenge centered on an Instacart [dataset](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017) containing 3 million Instacart orders.

For this challenge, I was required to calculate, for each department, the number of times a product was requested, the number of times a product was requested for the first time, and a ratio of those two numbers.
